Experiments in user-centered, multi-user [worldbuilding tools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worldbuilding) for the Internet Computer.

Initial POC goals: 

 - End-user tools for describing [Candid](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/candid-spec/idl) types and data values
  - These tools use, and generate, interactive menus based on Candid types.
  - The various menus do various things:
    - Some generate new Candid data.
    - Others query existing Candid data.
  - The data is generated by users, and collected by other users.

A work in progress.
